## Professional Objective

Experienced Linux/*nix systems administrator seeks challenging and enlightened workplace, ideally focusing on utilizing and extending free and open source technology in a virtualized computing environment.

## About Me

My career goals include increasing system efficiency and process automation while emphasizing stability, performance and security. I have been involved in all levels of systems implementation and operation including design, build, maintenance and replacement cycles of large and small environments. As a Linux/*nix user and administrator for well over a decade, I feel at home in the environment and believe I would be a valuable asset to any organization in search of a dependable, enterprising systems administrator or engineer, a developer specializing in integration of diverse environments or an all-around technology specialist. Computing fascinates me both professionally and personally, and I consume technical information for both enjoyment and career development. A deep interest in technology allows me to be a self-starter and quick study.  This has proven to be advantageous in adapting to and working in complex, ever-changing environments. Interest in and experience with buildout, delivery and consumption of cloud-based services provides a valuable perspective on the future of IT, large- and small-scale systems design and implementation, and the computing industry as a whole.
